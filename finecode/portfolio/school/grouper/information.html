              A Grouper App I created that is used by Avatar: Flight of Passage
              to help place individuals on remaining seats as well as track
              seats that are inoperable.

        <h2>What is a Grouper?</h2>
        <p>
          While training theme park attractions a trainer needs to teach the
          position of Grouper. A Grouper's job is to take individuals and
          parties and place them on ride vehicles or in theaters in the most
          efficient way possible to minimize the wait time for those in line.
        </p>

        <h2>Why a Different App?</h2>
        <p>
          Most random number generators will choose numbers at random where
          if the max number if 10, one could get any one of those numbers.
          The Grouper Training App gives a weight or precedence to numbers that
          naturally and acurately come up statistically more often. This App
          gives higher weight to groups of 2-8 specifically 2,4,6.
