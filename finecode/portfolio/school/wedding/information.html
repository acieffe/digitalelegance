          On Leap Day (February 29), 2020, I proposed to my then girlfriend of
          three years. This application allows my to calculate the days
          remaining from the current date. It also calculates an entered cost
          to the wedding and then divides that cost over the remaining days.
        </p>

        <h2>Calculations & Data</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            todaysDate = Date() (standard function that retreives today's date)
          </li>
          <li>
            weddingDate = User defined future date
          </li>
          <li>
            weddingCost = User defined cost of the wedding
          </li>
          <li>
            countdown = Calculated by subtracting today's date from the future
            date supplied by the user
          </li>
          <li>
            savings = Calculated by dividing the user defined cost by the
            countdown calculated number
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p>
          Countdown is displayed in the form of days remaining and savings is
          displayed in a dollar form per day until the wedding day.
