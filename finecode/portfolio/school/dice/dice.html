  Assignment: Dice Game
  Author: Matthew Baugh
  Date: 8/22/2020
  Purpose: In this game, the player will roll two dice and the computer will
  roll two dice. The Math.random() method will be used to generate each roll
  of a die, from 1 to 6. The sum of the computer’s roll should be compared to
  the sum of the player’s roll and whoever has the greater sum is the winner of
  that round. The sum of the winner’s roll for that round should be added to
  his or her point total. Use functions to call for each roll of two dice and
  the sum, for keeping track of the points, and to allow the player to continue
  or quit after a round of play. The following are the game rules: If one player
  rolls doubles (i.e., two fours or two sixes, etc.) and is a winner for that
  round, he or she should get double points. If one player rolls doubles but
  is not a winner, nothing special happens. If the two sums for any round are
  a tie, no one gets any points. The game ends when either player reaches at
  least 100 points or when the human player wants to quit.
